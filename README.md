FireRed and LeafGreen Egg Delay Calculator
=====
A very simple program to help you hit the correct frames/advances for egg rng in FireRed and LeafGreen  

For some reason, setting the Held Delay to 18 and the Pickup Delay to 3 in PokéFinder just doesn't do anything, so this program just properly applies the delay  

Usage
=====
Step 1. Pick a Pokémon from the results that you want to get

Step 3. Press ctrl + c  
Step 4. Start the program and paste your advances  
![3](img/3.png?raw=true)  
Now just aim to hit these new advances and it should result in your desired Pokémon
